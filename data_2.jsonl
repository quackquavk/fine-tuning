Unlike sequential circuits, a combinational circuit listens for input signal and and generates output no matter what is the past input or state as it has no feedback or memory component. It only cares about present input and state.\n Types of Adders: 1) Half Adder and 2) Full Adder\n Half Adder: Half Adder is a combinational logic circuit that is designed by connecting one EX-OR gate and one AND gate. The half-adder circuit has two inputs: A and B, which add two input digits and generate a carry and a sum. \n Full Adder: Full Adder is the circuit that consists of two EX-OR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate. Full Adder is the adder that adds three inputs and produces two outputs which consist of two EX-OR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is designated as C-OUT and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM."}]}
