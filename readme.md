# Digital Logic and Computer Design AI

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered system designed to generate questions and predict examination trends in the field of Digital Logic and Computer Design. The AI analyzes patterns in past questions to predict future trends and generate high-quality questions across various topics such as Binary System, Boolean Algebra, Logic Gates, and more.

## Features

- **Question Generation**: Automatically generates questions of varying difficulty levels and types (numerical, theoretical, design, analysis).
- **Trend Prediction**: Analyzes past examination patterns to predict future trends.
- **High-Quality Content**: Ensures questions are relevant and aligned with industry standards and examination trends.

## Chapters Covered

- Binary System
- Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates
- Simplification of Boolean Functions
- Combinational Logic
- Sequential Logic
- Registers, Counters, and Memory Unit
- Processor Logic Design
- Control Logic Design
- Digital Integrated Circuits

## Usage

1. **Question Generation**: Input the desired chapter, difficulty level, and question type to generate a question.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Review the pattern analysis and future trends provided for each question to understand examination trends.
